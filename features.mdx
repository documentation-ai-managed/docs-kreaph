## Overview

Kreaph provides powerful tools to manage your project documentation. You organize content into spaces and folders, collaborate with teams, track versions, and share exports easily. These features streamline your workflow from creation to distribution.

<Callout kind="info">
  Start with a space to group related documents. All core features integrate seamlessly.
</Callout>

## Spaces and Folders

Organize documents hierarchically using spaces for projects and folders for subtopics.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a Space" icon="database">
    Navigate to the Spaces dashboard and click `New Space`.

    Enter a name like `Project Alpha` and select a brand color such as `#3B82F6`.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Folders" icon="folder">
    Inside the space, create folders like `API Docs` and `User Guides`.

    Drag and drop MDX files to organize content.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Nest Folders" icon="folder-plus">
    Create subfolders for deeper hierarchy, such as `API Docs > Endpoints > Users`.
  </Step>
</Steps>

This structure keeps large documentation sets navigable.
